## Bit Manipulation
### CC150
### 5.1 [Insertion](/cc150/insertion.java)
You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a mwthod to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between 3 and 2.

### 5.2 [Binary to String](/cc150/binaryToString.java)
Given a real number between 0 and 1(for example, 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR".
